# OfficeCalendar
What is the purpose of this project? 

The goal of this project is to create a ‘social agenda’ application that will make it clear to Calendify when employees will come to work and show up to certain events like cooking nights or getaways. This app should also encourage employees to show up to work physically as much as possible. 

What problem does this project solve? 

The website makes it easier for employees to see who will come to the office/events. It will also be easier for managers to announce and manage attendance to events
